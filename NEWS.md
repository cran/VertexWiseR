# VertexWiseR v1.3.0

## NEW FEATURES
* TFCE computation is now optimized for speed: previously, the parallel steps in the foreach loop were building the linear model again every time; now the model will be saved as a file in a temporary directory (tempdir(), which automatically gets cleaned up), and this file will be loaded within the foreach loop instead.
 
## FIXES
* TFCE_vertex_analysis_mixed(): The random variable was not being  processed identically in BrainStat between the permuted and unpermuted model, because of a setting factorizing the variable in only one case. Now random variables are both factorized. This affected the coefficients and t-stat estimations, and the results of Example 2, which no longer shows negative clusters. This makes the outcome more consistent with the RFT results (TFCE being more conservative). We apologise for overlooking this inconsistency in the code. Please refer to Example 2 as presented in the package 1.3.0 vignette and website page for the accurate results.

# VertexWiseR v1.2.1

## NEW FEATURES
* Reticulate's [last update](https://posit.co/blog/reticulate-1-41/) allows users to install ephemeral Python environments with UV instead of requiring a stable Python/Miniconda installation. If users create their own with py_require() before running VertexWiseR, such environment will be selected automatically. If no Python environment is found, VertexWiseR now gives the choice to either install an ephemeral environment with UV, or to install Miniconda or Python via the classic ways.

## FIXES
* SURFvextract() now gives a proper error message if subjects' surface measure files could not be found. It also will get rid of the sublist.txt which was outputted automatically if subj_ID was set to FALSE. 
* Fix for messages that were silenced by mistake during Miniconda's installations process.
* Fix for the script using pip/pip3 to install properly vtk (9.3.1) when choosing the classic Python installation.

# VertexWiseR v1.2.0

## NEW FEATURES

* Update for RFT_vertex_analysis: now outputs also the unthresholded tstat map; Rdoc fixed accordingly (setting p=1 as previously advised caused errors, it doesn't simply output the unthresholded tstat map)
* SURFvextract() now has the optional argument fshomepath. This ensures FreeSurfer's environment is accessed by R and set up again if the function is used from RStudio. This is needed because RStudio does not inherit the system variables set before opening it from a terminal. 
* If the surf_data argument (in modelling or smoothing functions) is a list object with the subject list along with the surface matrix (as outputted by extraction functions with subj_ID=TRUE), the code automatically detects the matrix in that list, named "surf_obj", instead of forcing users to specify the matrix. 
* Modelling functions now accept a string with the path to the .rds file outputted by extraction functions, instead of only the matrix itself as the surf_data argument
* New function CAT12vextract() which allows surface data resampled to 32k meshes in CAT12 to be extracted and converted to a surface .rds object. This works with any measure applicable for the 32k resampled meshes ('thickness', 'depth', 'fractaldimension', 'gyrification', and 'toroGI20mm'). 
* New vignette/article gives advice on how to solve various Python-related issues
* Numpy version check is no longer present as pip replaces it upon BrainStat's installation with the compatible version

## FIXES
* Python package 'vtk' causes issues in latest 9.4.0 versions. The correct 9.3.1 version is now installed when installing Miniconda or reticulate's Python environment via VWRfirstrun(). 
* The cmap argument in plot_surf() is now converted to class color if not in that class by default
* Surface extracters fix: Working directory is restored before saving the RDS instead of on exit for HIPvextract() and FSLRvetract(). This ensures the filename is not interpreted as relative to the sdirpath (subjects directory).
* Fixed a parameter that was skipping VWR_check if smooth_surf() or TFCE_threshold() were nested to avoid VWR_check's repetition. This caused issues for non-interactive sessions/other nesting situations. Now, instead: For TFCE_threshold(), users calling it may manually set the argument VWR_check=FALSE if they want it to be skipped. For smooth_surf(), now VWR_check will be skipped if the parent function is identified as "model_check" as it will mean the smooth function is run from a function that already have a VWR_check (RFT_vertex_analysis, TFCE_vertex_analysis and TFCE_vertex_analysis_mixed functions). 
* Fix for non-miniconda Python installation: numpy, vtk and brainstat were installed via system('') but the optional use of pip or pip3 did not work properly in Windows due to a unix syntax error. The pip3 installation is now only triggered if an error occurs with the first system('pip ...') call. Furthermore, reticulate's environment is loaded immediately after the Python installation to make sure the pip function can be used subsequently to install the required packages. Other minor improvements in the messages printed during the VWRfirstrun() installation process.
* VWRfirstrun(): One message was still showing even if promptless=TRUE, this is now fixed
* FSLRvextract(): Default filename fixed (simply 'fslr32k.rds')
* To avoid instability, the reticulate Miniconda installation is now set at v.24.9.2 instead of the latest

# VertexWiseR v1.1.0

## NEW FEATURES
* New plotsurf_3d() function: allows surface data to be plotted in a 3D viewer via the plotly interface
* The [extraction tutorial](https://cogbrainhealthlab.github.io/VertexWiseR/articles/VertexWiseR_surface_extraction.html) now also gives FreeSurfer preprocessed data for demonstration	
* plot_surf() now accepts atlas ROI values from atlases supported by atlas_to_surf()
* atlas_to_surf() now works with hippocampal surface data
* smooth_surf() allows to enter a path to a surface .rds object instead of inputting the object itself

## FIXES

* For miniconda/python libraries installations via VWRfirstrun(), pip3 added as an alternative used if pip install fails
* Fixed Surface extraction tutorial (download.file had the wrong url/method, untar added as alternative as unzip had possible failures for the demo surface data)
* Fixes for MacOS (better custom path management, SURFvextract() compatibility issue fixed)
